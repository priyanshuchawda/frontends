just check what all are left 

. CORE FUNCTIONALITY (Don’t skip these)
Board Layout
Kanban columns for different statuses (e.g., To Do / In Progress / Done)
Ability to add, delete, rename columns (custom statuses)
Tasks
CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) for tasks
Drag & drop tasks between columns/statuses (smooth DnD!)
Each task: title, description, deadline, status
Deadlines/Calendar
Visual deadline indication (color highlight if overdue/near)
Optional: calendar view, to see tasks by due date
Details Modal/Drawer
Click task to open details (edit fields, describe, see deadlines)
Support for task comments/notes
Persistence
Fake/mock API or local storage (since backend isn’t required) so state isn't lost on reload

2. UI/UX POLISH (High Judging Weight)
Modern, clean, responsive design (mobile to desktop)
Use animations/transitions for drag-and-drop, modals, etc.
Color coding by status, priority, overdue, or assigned user
Intuitive navigation! (Sidebar, top nav, etc. if needed)
Polished empty states, loading skeletons
3. ADVANCED FEATURES (For “wow!”)
Task Assignment (Assign tasks to users, maybe display avatar/initials as mock data)
Subtasks/checklists (e.g., Checklist inside a task)
Labels/Tags (Tasks can have colored tags or categories)
Task Priorities (High/Medium/Low, with icons/colors)
Search/filter & sort (by title, due date, priority, label, assignee, etc.)
Bulk actions (select multiple tasks to move/delete)
Real-time collaboration (If you have time, mock real-time using localStorage events across tabs, or note that "multi-user" is simulated since backend isn’t allowed)
Notifications/toasts (e.g. “Task moved!” popups)
Light/Dark mode
Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast)
Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., “N” for new task, arrow keys to move selection)
Export/Import (Download the board to JSON/CSV, re-import)
4. VISUAL DESIGN & BRANDING
Distinct visual identity; don’t mimic Trello/Asana too closely
Custom logo/icon and app name
Consistent spacing, font choices, color palette, and well-designed button states & feedback
5. TECHNICAL QUALITY (Code will be reviewed for ties)
Well-organized code, re-usable components
Typescript (if using React etc) for type safety
Custom hooks/utilities if logic is complex
Proper state management (use React’s Context, Zustand, Redux, etc. — not overkill!)
Component-level separation: Board > Column > Task > Modal etc.
Clean, commented codebase with README, instructions
Deployed on Vercel/Netlify, quick load time, no console errors
6. EXTRA "WOW" FACTORS
Animations (e.g., when a task moves, new columns appear)
Customizable board (user can change its colors/bg, custom column icons, etc.)
Product tour/onboarding
Offline support/PWA (optional but impressive! "Offline mode enabled")
Gorgeous minimal illustrations, icons
Demo/mock login (choose a persona; assign tasks)
Activity/Change log (see who moved which task when—even if just fake data)
7. THINGS TO SKIP
Back-end (The rules say to fake/mock!)
Full auth, or real-time servers: focus on polished FE, stateful UX
